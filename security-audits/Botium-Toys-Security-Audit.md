## **3. Security Controls Assessment**
### ✅ **Implemented Security Controls**
- [x] **Firewall configured** with defined security rules.
- [x] **Antivirus software installed** and monitored regularly.

### **Missing & Required Security Controls**
- [ ] **Encryption for customer data** – Protect credit card information in storage.
- [ ] **Centralized password management** – Implement a secure credential storage solution.
- [ ] **Access controls with least privilege** – Restrict access based on job roles.
- [ ] **Disaster recovery & backup strategy** – Ensure business continuity in case of an incident.

---

## **4. Recommendations for Improvement**
To enhance security and compliance, the following measures should be taken:
1. **Implement encryption** for all stored customer credit card details to ensure confidentiality.
2. **Deploy an IDS** to monitor and detect suspicious network activities.
3. **Enforce access controls** based on the **principle of least privilege**.
4. **Strengthen password security policies** and introduce mandatory multi-factor authentication (MFA).
5. **Develop a comprehensive disaster recovery plan**, including **automated backups**.

---

## **5. Compliance & Regulatory Considerations**
The organization must comply with the following industry regulations:
- **GDPR** – Protect customer data in compliance with EU privacy laws.
